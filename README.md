# Robonavigation-Using-RL
RL ROBO NAVIGATION

The project's purpose is to develop a reinforcement learning agent that can guide the Turtlebot 3 robot across a simulated environment while avoiding collisions with objects in its path.
In order to accomplish the aim effectively, the agent must learn to interpret depth images from a camera and provide the robot the proper velocity commands. 
The goal is to increase the reward while minimising collisions and suboptimal behaviours. The reward is based on the distance to the target, orientation, velocity, and depth.
